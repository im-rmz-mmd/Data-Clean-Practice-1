The first data cleaning project I did for practice.

This project was implemented in a completely beginner and introductory way with pandas.
Here, I had'nt yet learned how to work with matplotlib, so I used colorama for visualization, which is a positive point in itself!

One of the points you should keep in mind for data cleaning is what is your goal for data cleaning? What do I want?
You should sort the things you want and remove the extras, which unfortunately was not followed seriously in this project!

What is the important educational point of this project?
The code is somewhat clean, and it's really good for a first project and you can even learn good educational points from it!
But if we want to choose the most important point, we can mention the Avg_Users column.
I created this column myself and it shows the average of the two columns Voted_Users and Reviews_Users, which is a good educational point, sometimes you need to create columns depending on the goal!
Data cleaning is not just about deleting!

But why is the output of the project so long? 
If you do a simple check, the first output of this project is all the sorted data, so everything is normal and normal so far.
But what about the rest?
I answered a few questions in color with colorama
Yellow = top sale
Green = low budget
Blue = latest release
Red = highest IMDB score
